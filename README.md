# React Todo List Demo

> This repository is for demonstration and learning purposes only. It is **not intended to be run or downloaded as a standalone app**.

This repo contains the source code for a simple React Todo List component and its custom hook.  

It demonstrates:  
- A React component  
- A custom hook to encapsulate state and behaviour  
- localStorage persistence  
- Drag-and-drop reordering  

> Note: The component relies on Tailwind CSS from my portfolio site for styling.
